# DogBoneVFD

The VFD display (IVL2-7/5) is a piece of soviet new-old-stock (NOS), and has a unique look to it. Making a watch out of it is cooler still.

Inspiration for this watch is credited to Johngineer for his IVL2-7/5 based watch 'ChronodeVFD'. At the time of writing his project can be found on his blog at http://www.johngineer.com/blog/?p=1595. You should check it out, itâ€™s gorgeous.
